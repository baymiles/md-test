# System Architecture

## Overview

The large-scale recommendation system architecture is divided into multiple components, each responsible for a specific functionality to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability. This architecture is based on a microservices design, leveraging containerization, distributed computing, and event-driven frameworks.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing

- **Extractors**: Responsible for retrieving data from external sources, including APIs and databases.
- **Transformers**: Perform data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare data for model training.
- **Loaders**: Load processed data into data storage systems like Hadoop or S3.

### 2. Model Training

- **Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization**: Models for generating recommendations based on user-item interactions.
- **Deep Learning**: Uses neural networks to capture complex patterns in user behavior and preferences.
- **Pipelines**: End-to-end workflows managing data input, model training, and evaluation.

### 3. Model Serving and Deployment

- **Inference API**: Provides a scalable API for real-time inference requests.
- **Autoscaling**: Handles dynamic adjustment of resources to manage fluctuating workloads.
- **Monitoring**: Tracks model performance and infrastructure health to maintain service stability.

### 4. Recommendation Logic

- **Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization Algorithms**: Generate personalized recommendations for users.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Enhance the accuracy of recommendations using TensorFlow.
- **Feedback Loop**: Continuously refines recommendations based on user behavior and feedback.

### 5. Data Storage and Management

- **Databases**: Store structured data with schemas optimized for user-item interactions.
- **Data Lakes and Warehouses**: Manage raw and processed data for efficient retrieval and analysis.

## Event-Driven Architecture

Utilizes an event-bus system to process user actions and feedback asynchronously. Producers publish events related to interactions, while consumers handle feedback processing in real-time.

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Scala, Java
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Terraform, Helm
