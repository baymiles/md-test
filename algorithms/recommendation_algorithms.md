# Recommendation Algorithms

## Overview

The recommendation system utilizes a combination of collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and deep learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations to users. Each algorithm has its own advantages in terms of scalability, performance, and accuracy.

### 1. Collaborative Filtering (CF)

- **Approach**: Based on the similarity between users or items, collaborative filtering recommends items that similar users have interacted with.
- **Implementation**: The `cf_algorithm.py` script uses Python to perform collaborative filtering based on user-item interaction matrices.
- **Pros**: Simple to implement and interpret, effective in sparse datasets.
- **Cons**: Does not handle cold-start problems well.

### 2. Matrix Factorization (MF)

- **Approach**: Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices, capturing latent factors that describe user preferences and item characteristics.
- **Implementation**: The `mf_algorithm.scala` script implements matrix factorization using Scala for efficient large-scale processing.
- **Pros**: Handles sparse data efficiently, scalable for large datasets.
- **Cons**: Requires matrix decomposition, which can be computationally intensive.

### 3. Deep Learning (DL)

- **Approach**: Utilizes neural networks to capture complex relationships between users and items, improving the accuracy of recommendations for highly diverse user bases.
- **Implementation**: The `dl_algorithm.py` script leverages TensorFlow for deep learning-based recommendations.
- **Pros**: Highly accurate, able to model non-linear relationships.
- **Cons**: Computationally expensive and requires large amounts of data.

### 4. Ensemble Methods

- **Approach**: Combines multiple recommendation algorithms to improve the overall recommendation accuracy.
- **Implementation**: The `ensemble.java` class merges the outputs of the CF, MF, and DL models to provide a final recommendation.
- **Pros**: Leverages the strengths of multiple algorithms.
- **Cons**: Increased complexity and computational cost.

## Feedback Loop

A feedback loop is incorporated to continuously improve the recommendation models. The `feedback.py` script processes user feedback to adjust model parameters and improve future recommendations.

### Personalization

The `personalization.scala` script enables real-time personalization of recommendations based on a user's interaction history and preferences.

### Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, Scala, Java
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow for deep learning
