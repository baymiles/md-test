# Deployment Guide

This guide outlines the steps required to deploy the sentiment analysis model using both Python and R environments. Docker is used to ensure the model runs smoothly in a containerized environment.

## 1. Docker Setup

- **File**: `deployment/docker/Dockerfile`
- A Dockerfile that sets up the environment for running the model. It includes dependencies for both Python and R, allowing models written in both languages to be deployed together.

## 2. Multi-Container Orchestration

- **File**: `deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml`
- Docker Compose is used to orchestrate multiple containers, which may include different services for Python and R-based sentiment analysis models.

## 3. Deployment to AWS

- **File**: `deployment/scripts/deploy_aws.py`
- Python script to deploy the containerized model to AWS using services like EC2 or ECS. Includes steps for creating an instance and setting up the model API.

## 4. Deployment to GCP

- **File**: `deployment/scripts/deploy_gcp.py`
- Python script for deploying the sentiment analysis model to Google Cloud Platform, leveraging GCP's container management and hosting solutions.

## 5. REST API

- **File**: `deployment/api/app.py`
- A Python-based Flask or FastAPI app that serves the model via a REST API.
- This API accepts text input and returns the sentiment classification result.

## 6. R API

- **File**: `deployment/api/app.R`
- An R-based plumber API that exposes R sentiment models via a REST interface. Useful for serving R models in production.

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

- For ongoing monitoring of the model's performance, see the `monitoring/` folder for logging and metric tracking.
